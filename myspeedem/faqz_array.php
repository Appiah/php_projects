	$faqz_2_contnt = "Upload Tool is designed for bulk messaging by easy and time-saving upload of all necessary data. You can use this tool for sending messages to contacts that are not imported into your Customer Web. This tool is especially useful for quick, one-time bulk sending to multiple destinations. When using this sending method follow the procedure below:<p>
<b>0/6 Preparing a file for upload:</b><br>
If you don't already have a file prepared for upload, you have to create it. This upload file can be in any of the following formats: .txt, .csv, .xls, and has to contain sender or recipient details or message text sorted in columns (at least one column must contain data). For example, when sending the same message with the same sender ID to multiple destinations, all you need to do is upload a file containing destination numbers sorted in a column. When sending different messages with different sender IDs to numerous destinations, you have to define these details by sorting them in columns. Each column represents a data group and each line represents a single piece of data and must contain appropriate details (e.g. the destination column must contain destination mobile numbers). Data must be delimited using one of the following: tab, comma, semicolon or hash.<p>
<b>1/6 File Upload:</b><br>
File Upload is designed to save your time by uploading all the data from one place and sending messages with only a few clicks. Click Browse to select the message file and click UPLOAD.<p>
<b>2/6 Preview Data:</b><br>
The Options box: the system automatically detects only the tab separation. If you used # or comma to delimit the values, you must enter them in the Detected delimiter field. This way you will avoid cases where, when using several commas in your text, comma is detected as the delimiter instead of e.g. hash, which you intended as the separator.
First row as headers: if you are naming value columns for your own reference, checking this box will recognize the first line as the name(s) of column(s).
Choose file encoding: Allows you to select different alphabet settings.
Click APPLY as needed.
The Uploaded data box displays the values entered in the text: note that the appearance varies according to the number of recipients, delimiter type etc., as well as before and after applying the options.<p>
<b>3/6 Create Message:</b><br>
In the Message Body box, from the drop down box select which of the entered values is the message text and click INSERT TO MESSAGE. Click QUICK PREVIEW for a message preview. If you didn't upload message content because you're sending the same message to all the recipients, you can type the text in the message body.
The Sender box allows you to select the numeric (Data) or alphanumeric (Text) sender ID. The Data ID value has to be selected from the drop down box, while the Text ID is the Default Sender ID definable in the My Account section under General Account information.
Message Options defines data coding (text/binary) and message type (normal/flash), selecting them from their respective drop down boxes.
In the Recipient box you define the recipients by selecting the appropriate value from the drop down box.<p>
<b>4/6 Data Processing:</b><br>
This section gives an overview of the actions and their results. The Results box displays successes and errors, while the Good Records box displays successful progress. In case of Bad Records, the Hints display why messages are treated as bad.<p>
<b>5/6 Analysis Overview:</b>
Status box displays total message count, total price and final status.
Test SMS allows you to send a test message to a mobile number of your choice to confirm successful sending.
Send Status and Cost Overview compiles the above data, as well as destination network and country details.<p>
<b>6/6 Sending messages:</b><br>
The last step is sending the message. The Sending Time box lets you choose between immediate sending and scheduled sending. Selecting Scheduled opens up a dialogue box where you select date, time and time zone parameters.
Upload Name lets you name the particular job for your future reference.
Click SEND and you're done.";

To search for a contact, enter a name in the required field and click FILTER.
For easier contacts entry, use the Import contacts tool. For uploading from a file (.txt, .csv, .xls or .xlsx formats), select Upload file and browse for the required file. Click Add contacts to complete action.
For manual input, select the appropriate function and enter the numbers in the text box. Make sure to use comma as the delimiter. Click Add contacts to complete action.
The uploaded contacts by default have no group association. If you wish to assign them to an existing group, tick appropriate selection and select the group name from the drop down box. If you wish to create a new group, tick appropriate selection and enter new group name in the text box. Both actions need to be performed before completing action by clicking Add contacts.
